Introduction:

This project creates an application which runs some of the java programs completed in the labs from week 21 to week 2. 

The project also includes two programs which were completed by the students in their own time outside of the labs.

The application consists of a menu. On selection of a menu option, a program from the lab is run. When the program is complete it exits and returns to the menu.

The following programs are included:

Week 21:
Break_Ex2.java
FirstSwitch.java
Methods.java

Week 22:
No exercises from this week included. Focussed on creating putting together the application. Created a program named Index.java for this.

Week 23:
Shadow.java
Arithmetic.java
FirstArray.java
SecondArray.java

Week 24:
SecondArray.java (group B did not complete on week 23)
TryCatch.java
EnhancedFor.java
SearchStudent.java

Outside of lab:
Convert.java
Search.java

Setup the application:

1. Clone this repository to a device which has a Java Virtual Machine.
2. Compile all the java files.
3. Run Index.class file and select from the menu option a program to run.

Test Cases:
Some test cases for Convert.java and Search.java are included in TestCases.xlsx.
